# Prediction-for-Landcover-Change-Analysis
The aim of this study is to produce a land use land cover map of Slovenia at different epochs
in order to detect the changes that have taken place particularly in the built-up land and
subsequently predict likely changes that might take place in the same over a given period.
The following specific objectives will be pursued in order to achieve the aim above.

 To create a land use land cover classification scheme
 To determine the trend, nature, rate, location and magnitude of land use land cover
change.
 To forecast the future pattern of land use land cover in the area.
 To generate data on land consumption rate and land absorption coefficient
   since more emphasis is placed on built-up land.
 To evaluate the socio – economic implications of predicted change.
